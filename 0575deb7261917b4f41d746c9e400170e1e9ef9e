      "message": "Agreed - In my current Ubuntu 18.04 baremetal setup, I solved the issue by defining the missing packages directly in container-experience-kits/roles/bootstrap/install_packages/. Copying over this playbook to the VM and running it from Docker container didn\u0027t function well in my setup. \nSince you mentioned that BMRA 2.1 which will be released in the coming weeks fixes these issues, I am wondering if its easier that we continue our current development with CentOS and update this patch (and subsequent support for Ubuntu) after the release, unless there is an urgent need/requirement.",
