From what I understand, the \"full\" deployment handles this in provision_hosts(), but since this isn\u0027t needed for Equinix Metal \"k8s\" it is instead done through copy_files_jump(), utilizing the existing private key from the host, as this is already authorized for connecting to the target machines.",
