      "message": "I guess Michael had added this section when he was testing it on his Ubuntu 20.04 setup. I believe these requirements are needed when deploying RI2 on pre-provisioned Ubuntu 20.04 systems. Perhaps we can add this as a note, or add a section \"Deployment on provider (or pre-provisioned) infrastructure\" to highlight this.",

      "message": "Looking at the notes here, they seem to be for preparing the environment for running the installer (not the target systems). I don\u0027t think Ironic will install anything here that breaks the existing steps. It might be the case if the target servers are running Ubuntu 20.04 (and I believe Ubuntu wasn\u0027t initially supported as target OS)",

      "message": "The Jumphost OS (on the physical server) should be fine with either Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 (with this section describing the steps for Ubuntu 20.04). The Ironic part happens in the kuberef-jump VM, which deploys Ubuntu 18.04 unless the Ansible role for the VM (kuberef/playbooks/roles/jump-vm/tasks) is modified to use a different image.\n\nMy local setup uses pre-provisioned servers, so Ironic isn\u0027t used. As a result I can\u0027t test this exact issue myself, but I just tried with the Jumphost (not VM) running Ubuntu 20.04 (as well as the two target servers), and the installation was successful",
