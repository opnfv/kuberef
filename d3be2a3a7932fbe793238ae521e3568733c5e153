      "message": "I guess Michael had added this section when he was testing it on his Ubuntu 20.04 setup. I believe these requirements are needed when deploying RI2 on pre-provisioned Ubuntu 20.04 systems. Perhaps we can add this as a note, or add a section \"Deployment on provider (or pre-provisioned) infrastructure\" to highlight this.",

      "message": "Looking at the notes here, they seem to be for preparing the environment for running the installer (not the target systems). I don\u0027t think Ironic will install anything here that breaks the existing steps. It might be the case if the target servers are running Ubuntu 20.04 (and I believe Ubuntu wasn\u0027t initially supported as target OS)",
